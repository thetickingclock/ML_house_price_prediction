Hello! Welcome to the project.

In this project I have used Machine Learning to predict home prices. Then I have created a 
Flask server and a front end that takes user input and then predicts the house prices.

To use the house price predictor.

1)Open the Server folder and run the py_flask.py
2)Open the client folder and run app.html
3)Input the values and click on Estimate
